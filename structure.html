        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
            men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
            darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
            thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
            you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most
            gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with
            it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>
        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name
            printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
            mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store.
            And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
            into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me,
            he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?</p>
